## Topics Covered and Mastery Assessment

### F.46 Final Comprehension Check

**Scenario:** Client Chen Wei (age 60, $900K retirement savings, healthy). Adult daughter has Down syndrome, receives SSI and Medicaid.

**Question 1:** Should Chen Wei buy LTC insurance for himself? Why or why not?

**Student's Answer:** "可以购买长期失能保险。当自己没有行动能力之后，可以用保险来覆盖开支。"

Translation: "Can buy long-term disability insurance. When one has no ability to move, can use insurance to cover expenses."

**Assessment:** ✓ **CORRECT** - Student correctly identified that Chen Wei should buy LTC insurance.

**CFP Context Provided:**
- Age 60 is optimal (sweet spot 55-60)
- $900K retirement savings = perfect candidate for LTC insurance (has enough to lose, not enough to self-fund)
- Healthy = can qualify for underwriting
- Family situation with disabled daughter = preserving assets important for her future care

**Mastery Level:** High - Understanding of LTC insurance decision-making

---

**Question 2:** Chen Wei wants to leave $200,000 to daughter when he dies. Should he:
- A) Leave directly in will
- B) Create Special Needs Trust
- C) Put $200,000 in ABLE account

**Student's Answer:** "B. 不能把钱直接留给孩子，否则孩子的存款超过2000，则不能申请 Medicaid救助。"

Translation: "B. Cannot leave money directly to child, otherwise child's savings exceed 2,000, cannot apply for Medicaid assistance."

**Assessment:** ✓ **EXCELLENT ANSWER!** - Perfect CFP reasoning:
1. Correctly chose Special Needs Trust (Option B)
2. Correctly explained WHY: Direct inheritance would exceed $2,000 asset limit
3. Shows understanding of SSI/Medicaid asset limit issue
4. Demonstrates understanding of why Special Needs Trusts exist

**Mastery Level:** High - Strong grasp of special needs planning concepts

---

## F.46 Completion Status

**Overall Assessment:** ✓ **COMPLETED AND MASTERED**

**Confidence Level:** High

**Key Concepts Mastered:**
1. LTC insurance features (daily benefit, benefit period, elimination period, inflation protection)
2. When to buy LTC insurance (optimal age 50-65, especially 55-60)
3. Self-funding vs insurance decision framework
4. Medicaid planning (eligibility, spend-down, 5-year lookback, spousal protection)
5. Special Needs Trusts
6. ABLE Accounts

**Knowledge Gaps:** None - All concepts mastered

**Strengths Demonstrated:**
- Practical decision-making (LTC insurance purchase timing)
- Understanding of complex coordination between insurance and government benefits
- Application of SSI/Medicaid asset limits to estate planning
- Clear articulation of why Special Needs Trusts are necessary

**Session Summary:**
Session completed the final comprehension check for F.46 Eldercare and Special Needs Planning. Student answered both questions correctly, demonstrating strong understanding of both practical LTC insurance decision-making and special needs estate planning. The second answer was particularly strong, showing clear understanding of why direct inheritance would jeopardize government benefits.

F.46 is now fully mastered. Ready to proceed to F.47 Types of Retirement Plans.

## F.47 Types of Retirement Plans (PART 1)

### Topics Covered:

**1. Defined Benefit vs Defined Contribution Plans**
- Defined Benefit (DB): Traditional pension, employer promises specific payout, employer bears risk
- Defined Contribution (DC): Account-based plan, value depends on contributions + investment returns, employee bears risk

**2. Qualified vs Non-Qualified Plans**
- Qualified: Meet IRS requirements, get tax advantages (401k, 403b, 457, IRAs, SEP, SIMPLE)
- Non-Qualified: No tax advantages, contributions not deductible, used when limits reached or for executives

**3. 401(k) - Private Sector Employer Plan**
- Traditional 401(k): Pre-tax, tax deduction now, taxed on withdrawal
- Roth 401(k): After-tax, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals
- Employer matching: "Free money" - always contribute enough to get full match
- Contribution limits: $23,000 (under 50), $30,500 (50+)
- Vesting: Employer match typically vests over 3-6 years

**Comprehension Check 1 (401k calculation):**
- Li Ming earns $120,000, contributes 8%, employer matches 50% up to 6%
- Student Answer: ✓ PERFECT - Correctly calculated $13,200 total ($9,600 personal + $3,600 employer)
- Key insight: Employee match only on first 6%, extra 2% gets no match

**4. 403(b) - Nonprofit/Government Employees**
- Same contribution limits as 401(k)
- May NOT have employer matching (many nonprofits don't match)
- Vesting typically immediate
- Investment options often limited (annuities vs mutual funds)

**5. 457 Plans - Government Employees**
- Key Feature: NO 10% early withdrawal penalty if leave job
- Separate limit from 401(a)/403(b) - can contribute to BOTH
- Special catch-up in last 3 years before retirement age

**Comprehension Check 2 (457b limits):**
- Wang Wei, city gov employee with 401(a) pension + 457(b), age 52
- Student Answer: D ($69,500) - Incorrect initially
- Corrected to B ($30,500) - Understood that 401(a) is typically employer-funded only
- Key learning: 401(a) = employer pension, employee doesn't contribute; 457(b) = employee contribution plan

**6. IRAs - Individual Retirement Accounts**

**Traditional IRA:**
- Pre-tax contributions → Tax deduction NOW
- Tax-deferred growth
- Withdrawals taxed as ordinary income
- RMDs required starting at 72
- Contribution limit: $7,000 (under 50), $8,000 (50+)

**Roth IRA:**
- After-tax contributions → No tax deduction now
- Tax-free growth → No taxes on investment earnings
- Tax-free withdrawals (if 59½ AND 5-year rule met)
- NO RMDs required
- Same contribution limits
- Income limits for direct contribution (2025: Single <$150k full, $150k-$165k partial, >$165k ineligible)

**Comprehension Check 3 (Roth IRA eligibility):**
- Chen Ling, age 32, single, earns $180,000
- Student Answer: ✓ CORRECT - Traditional IRA because income exceeds Roth IRA limit ($165,000)
- Discussed Backdoor Roth strategy for high earners

**Comprehension Check 4 (Optimal savings strategy):**
- Zhang Wei, age 28, single, earns $120,000, wants to save $15,000
- Student Answer: ✓ PERFECT - B: $10,000 in 401(k) + $5,000 in Roth IRA
- Reasoning: 401(k) gets employer match (free money), Roth IRA for tax-free growth and diversification
- Answer C wrong because Roth IRA limit is $7,000

**7. SEP IRA & SIMPLE IRA - For Small Businesses**

**SEP IRA:**
- For self-employed and small business owners
- Only employer contributes
- Contribution limit: Lesser of $69,000 OR 25% of compensation
- Must contribute equally to all eligible employees
- No catch-up contributions

**SIMPLE IRA:**
- For businesses with <100 employees
- Both employer and employees can contribute
- Employee limit: $16,000 (under 50), $19,500 (50+)
- Employer match required: 3% matching OR 2% non-elective

**Comprehension Check 5 (SEP IRA calculation):**
- Wang Lin, self-employed, earns $200,000, no employees
- Student Answer: C ($69,000) - Incorrect initially
- Corrected to A ($50,000) - Understood: SEP limit = lesser of $69,000 OR 25% of compensation
- Key learning: $69,000 is ceiling, but can't exceed 25% of earnings ($200,000 × 25% = $50,000)

**8. Comparison Summary Table**
- Covered comparison of 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), Traditional/Roth IRAs, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA

**Comprehension Check 6 (Maximum across multiple plans):**
- Li Ming, age 55, works for university (403b), earns $150,000, side consulting $30,000
- Session ended before completing this calculation
- Needs review: 403(b) age 55+ catch-up is $7,500 (special rule), so 403(b) max = $30,500

---

## F.47 Mastery Assessment (PART 1)

**Progress:** ~60% complete

**Confidence Level by Topic:**
- High: 401(k) calculations, Roth IRA eligibility, SEP IRA limit calculation
- Medium-High: Defined benefit vs defined contribution, 457(b) features
- Medium: 403(b) catch-up rules (special $7,500 for age 55+ needs clarification)

**Knowledge Gaps Identified:**
1. **403(b) age 55+ catch-up:** Student calculated $23,000 for 403(b), but correct is $30,500 ($23,000 + $7,500 special catch-up)
2. **Multiple plan coordination:** Final comprehension check was not completed - needs practice calculating total across 403b + Roth IRA + SEP IRA

**Strengths Demonstrated:**
- Excellent mathematical reasoning for calculations
- Good understanding of employer matching importance
- Clear grasp of Roth IRA income limits
- Quick learning on SEP IRA 25% rule
- Strong baseline knowledge of retirement plan types

**Performance on Comprehension Checks:**
- Check 1 (401k match): ✓ PERFECT
- Check 2 (457b limits): ✓ Corrected after explanation
- Check 3 (Roth IRA eligibility): ✓ CORRECT
- Check 4 (Optimal strategy): ✓ PERFECT
- Check 5 (SEP IRA limit): ✓ Corrected after explanation
- Check 6 (Multiple plans): INCOMPLETE
