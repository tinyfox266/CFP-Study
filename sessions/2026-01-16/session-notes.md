## Topics Covered and Mastery Assessment

### F.46 Final Comprehension Check

**Scenario:** Client Chen Wei (age 60, $900K retirement savings, healthy). Adult daughter has Down syndrome, receives SSI and Medicaid.

**Question 1:** Should Chen Wei buy LTC insurance for himself? Why or why not?

**Student's Answer:** "可以购买长期失能保险。当自己没有行动能力之后，可以用保险来覆盖开支。"

Translation: "Can buy long-term disability insurance. When one has no ability to move, can use insurance to cover expenses."

**Assessment:** ✓ **CORRECT** - Student correctly identified that Chen Wei should buy LTC insurance.

**CFP Context Provided:**
- Age 60 is optimal (sweet spot 55-60)
- $900K retirement savings = perfect candidate for LTC insurance (has enough to lose, not enough to self-fund)
- Healthy = can qualify for underwriting
- Family situation with disabled daughter = preserving assets important for her future care

**Mastery Level:** High - Understanding of LTC insurance decision-making

**Question 2:** Chen Wei wants to leave $200,000 to daughter when he dies. Should he:
- A) Leave directly in will
- B) Create Special Needs Trust
- C) Put $200,000 in ABLE account

**Student's Answer:** "B. 不能把钱直接留给孩子，否则孩子的存款超过2000，则不能申请 Medicaid救助。"

Translation: "B. Cannot leave money directly to child, otherwise child's savings exceed 2,000, cannot apply for Medicaid assistance."

**Assessment:** ✓ **EXCELLENT ANSWER!** - Perfect CFP reasoning:
1. Correctly chose Special Needs Trust (Option B)
2. Correctly explained WHY: Direct inheritance would exceed $2,000 asset limit
3. Shows understanding of SSI/Medicaid asset limit issue
4. Demonstrates understanding of why Special Needs Trusts exist

**Mastery Level:** High - Strong grasp of special needs planning concepts
