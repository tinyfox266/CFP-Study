**Session Duration:** Very brief (~5 minutes) - student requested to stop after introduction.

## Instructor Notes

**Session Summary:**
Brief introductory session for F.46. Student had no prior knowledge of eldercare planning (as expected). Introduction covered the basic problem: Medicare doesn't cover long-term care (connection to F.45), long-term care costs are extremely high ($100K-$120K/year for nursing home), and average duration is 2-3 years. Mentioned four planning solution categories but did not explain them yet.

Student requested to end session before first comprehension check. F.46 is approximately 5-10% complete.

**Pacing:**
Normal - some topics require building up energy/readiness. Student may have wanted a brief review of where they are before committing to a full learning session.

**Next Session Strategy:**
1. Quick recap of introduction (2 minutes)
2. Long-Term Care Insurance deep dive (~20 minutes)
3. LTC Insurance features and calculations (~15 minutes)
4. Self-funding vs insurance decision framework (~10 minutes)
5. Medicaid planning basics (~10 minutes)
6. Special needs trusts and ABLE accounts (~10 minutes)
7. Practice problems + final assessment (~15 minutes)

Total: ~80 minutes estimated for complete F.46 mastery

**Overall Assessment:**
Session too brief to assess learning. Student initiated session, reviewed baseline (no prior knowledge), received introduction to F.46, and requested to stop. This is normal - student may have wanted to check in before committing to a longer session. F.46 ready to complete in next session.
