## Topics Covered

### Initial Knowledge Check

**Question Asked**: "What do you already know about planning for education expenses?"

**Student's Initial Understanding**:
1. Regular savings from monthly salary for children's future education ✓
2. Not familiar with specific education savings vehicles (529 plans, etc.)
3. Challenge of keeping education funds separate and not using them ✓

**Assessment**: Good baseline understanding of regular savings concept (similar to DCA from B.12), honest about knowledge gaps

---

### 1. Education Needs Analysis - Four-Step Process

**Concepts Taught**:

**Step 1: Estimate Future Education Costs**
- Current costs (2025): Public in-state $28K, Out-of-state $46K, Private $60K per year
- Education inflation: 5-6% per year (higher than general inflation!)
- Formula: Future Cost = Current Cost × (1 + inflation)^years
- Typical duration: 4 years undergraduate

**Step 2: Determine Time Horizon**
- Time horizon affects monthly contribution needs and asset allocation
- Longer time = more aggressive allocation (80-90% stocks)
- As college approaches, shift to conservative (bonds, cash)
- Age-based asset allocation similar to retirement planning

**Step 3: Calculate Funding Gap**
- Gap = Total Future Cost - FV of Current Savings
- Must grow current savings to see what they'll become
- Gap represents what needs to be saved through monthly contributions

**Step 4: Calculate Required Monthly Savings**
- Use FV Annuity formula (from B.12) solved for PMT
- PMT = FV × r / [(1 + r)^n - 1]
- Apply monthly conversion (r/12, n×12) if saving monthly

---

### 2. First Comprehension Check - Basic Calculations

**Problem Given**: Child age 5, public in-state ($28K current), 6% inflation, 13 years to college

**Question 1**: Calculate one year future cost when child is 18

**Student's Response**: `28000*(1+6%)^13` ✓ **PERFECT**

**Question 2**: Calculate 4-year total (simplified)

**Student's Response**: `28000*(1+6%)^13*4` ✓ **PERFECT**

**Question 3**: Grow current $20K savings at 7% for 13 years

**Student's Response**: `20000*(1+7%)^13` ✓ **PERFECT**

**Assessment**: 3/3 = 100% - Flawless transfer of TVM knowledge from B.12 to education planning context

**Results Calculated**:
- One year cost: $59,760
- Four year total: $239,040
- Current savings growth: $48,103
- Funding gap: $190,937
- Monthly savings needed: $776/month

---

### 3. Key Factors Affecting Education Needs Analysis

**Factors Taught**:

1. **Type of School**
   - Public in-state (cheapest) vs private (most expensive)
   - Community college first 2 years strategy (cost-saving)

2. **Number of Children**
   - Twins = 4 years of double payments (overlapping)
   - Need to save MUCH more monthly or start earlier
   - Financial aid benefit: 2 in college can increase aid eligibility

3. **Financial Aid Considerations**
   - Expected Family Contribution (EFC)
   - Merit vs need-based scholarships
   - Not all assets count equally in aid calculations

4. **Funding Sources Mix**
   - CFP Rule of Thumb: 1/3 savings, 1/3 income, 1/3 loans/scholarships
   - Diversification reduces risk

5. **Flexibility and Assumptions**
   - Scholarships are uncertain - plan conservatively
   - Child may choose cheaper school
   - 529 plans have rules if child doesn't attend college

6. **Competing Goals - MOST CRITICAL**
   - **Retirement ALWAYS comes before education**
   - "You can borrow for college, but you can't borrow for retirement"
   - Financially independent parents reduce burden on children

---

### 4. Conceptual Understanding Check

**Question 1**: How do twins affect education planning vs one child?

**Student's Response**: "Two kids in college at same time = double expenses" ✓ **CORRECT**

**Feedback**: Correct core concept. Added nuance:
- 4 consecutive years of double payments
- Monthly savings doubles ($800 → $1,600)
- Financial aid benefit (EFC split between students)

**Understanding Level**: Good ✓

---

**Question 2**: Client assumes daughter will get full scholarship and isn't saving. What would you advise?

**Student's Response**: "Everything has risk, what if no scholarship? Best is 1/3 savings, 1/3 loans, 1/3 scholarships - leave margin for risk"

**Assessment**: ✓✓ **EXCELLENT CFP THINKING!**

**What Student Demonstrated**:
- Risk management principle
- Diversification of funding sources (1/3 rule)
- Conservative planning (plan for worst case, hope for best)
- Professional judgment over wishful thinking

**Feedback**: Perfect application of CFP risk management principles

---

**Question 3**: Client (age 35) has $50K - retirement account or college fund? They have no retirement savings yet.

**Student's Response**: "Should first plan retirement account. Kids can get loans for school. But retirement cannot get loans."

**Assessment**: ✓✓ **PERFECT!** - Nailed the most important principle

**Additional CFP Reasoning Added**:
- Parents have limited time for retirement (can't work forever)
- Kids have entire working life to pay student loans
- Underfunded retirement = may become burden on children
- Financially independent parents = gift to children

**Understanding Level**: Perfect ✓✓

---

### 5. Comprehensive Practice Problem - Chen Family Scenario

**Scenario**:
- Parents: Both age 35, income $120K/year
- Son: Age 8 (starts college in 10 years)
- Daughter: Age 5 (starts college in 13 years)
- Current savings: $15,000
- Goal: Public in-state for both ($28K/year current)
- Education inflation: 6%, Expected return: 7%

---

**Part 1: Calculations**

**Question 1**: Son's one-year future cost

**Student's Response**: `28000*(1+6%)^10` ✓ **PERFECT**
- Result: $50,122 per year

**Question 2**: Daughter's one-year future cost

**Student's Response**: `28000*(1+6%)^13` ✓ **PERFECT**
- Result: $59,760 per year

**Question 3**: Total for both children (4 years each)

**Student's Response**: `(28000*((1+6%)^10+(1+6%)^13))*4` ✓ **CORRECT**
- Formula structure is valid (distributive property)
- Son's 4 years: $200,488
- Daughter's 4 years: $239,040
- Total needed: $439,528

**Question 4**: Current savings growth (10 years)

**Student's Response**: `15000*(1+7%)^10` ✓ **PERFECT**
- Result: $29,507

**Part 1 Score**: 4/4 = 100% - Zero errors

---

**Part 2: CFP Judgment**

**Question 5**: $1,000/month to save - split evenly or differently between two kids?

**Student's Response**: "Don't split evenly because daughter's school date is further away, can have more time to save. Give son more, daughter less."

**Assessment**: ✓✓ **EXCELLENT CFP REASONING!**

**What Student Understood**:
- Time horizon affects monthly contribution needs
- Son needs money sooner (10 years) = needs more monthly savings now
- Daughter has more time (13 years) = can save less now, redirect later
- Uneven allocation based on time horizon (not equal split)

**CFP Strategy Taught**:
- Front-load savings for older child
- When son starts college, redirect savings to daughter
- Consider paying some from current income during enrollment

**Understanding Level**: Excellent ✓✓ - Demonstrated sophisticated time horizon thinking

---

**Question 6**: Parents have NO retirement savings (age 35). How to allocate $1,000/month?

**Student's Response**: "Should first reserve retirement funds, then consider education funds."

**Assessment**: ✓✓✓ **PERFECT APPLICATION!**

**Realistic CFP Allocation Discussed**:
- Age 35 with $0 retirement = CRISIS situation
- Need minimum 15% of $120K income = $1,500/month (but only have $1,000!)
- **Recommendation**: $800 retirement, $200 education
- Will NOT fully fund college - must use 1/3 approach (savings + income + aid)

**Key CFP Message**: "Best gift to children is NOT becoming their financial burden in retirement."

**Understanding Level**: Perfect ✓✓✓ - Consistently prioritizes retirement correctly

---

## Final Mastery Assessment - B.13

**Question 1 (Concept)**: TRUE or FALSE - Education inflation (5-6%) is typically HIGHER than general inflation (2-3%)

**Student's Response**: TRUE ✓ **CORRECT**

---

**Question 2 (Calculation)**: Child age 12, private university ($60K current), 6% inflation. Calculate one-year cost at age 18.

**Student's Response**: `60000*(1+6%)^6` ✓ **PERFECT**
- Correct time calculation: 18 - 12 = 6 years
- Perfect formula setup
- Result: $85,029

---

**Question 3 (CFP Judgment)**: Client age 40 with $80K retirement, $0 education savings. Child age 10. Where to invest $30K?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "优先存退休账户" (Prioritize retirement account)

**Follow-up Asked**: Explain WHY in English

**Student's Comprehensive Response** (translated from Chinese):
"They're approaching retirement age and may need retirement funds soon. Their current savings are low ($80K at age 40 is behind). Retirement should be prioritized because **you can't borrow for retirement, but kids can borrow for college**. Being financially independent in retirement also **reduces the burden on children**."

**Assessment**: ✓✓✓ **EXCEPTIONAL CFP REASONING!**

**What Made This Answer Outstanding**:
1. Age analysis - recognized $80K is insufficient for age 40
2. Priority principle - applied core rule correctly
3. Alternative funding - understood kids have loan options
4. **Intergenerational perspective** - added insight about not burdening children (shows holistic CFP thinking beyond just formulas)

---

**Question 4 (Multiple Factors)**: Which factors affect education needs analysis? (Type of school, Number of children, Age of child, Parents' retirement savings, Scholarships, Competing goals)

**Student's Response**: A B C D E F (all of them) ✓ **PERFECT**

**Correct Reasoning**:
- All factors DO affect education planning:
  - Type of school → affects cost
  - Number of children → affects total need and overlapping years
  - Age of child → affects time horizon and allocation
  - Parents' retirement → competing goal that limits education allocation
  - Scholarships → affects planning assumptions and risk
  - Competing goals → affects realistic allocation decisions

---

**Final Assessment Score**: 4/4 = 100% ✓✓✓

---
