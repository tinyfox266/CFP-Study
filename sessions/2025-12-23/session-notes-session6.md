## Session Details

### Topic: B.10 Financing Strategies and Debt Management

**Status:** STARTED but NOT MASTERED - Introduction only

#### Initial Understanding Assessment
- **Question 1:** "When you think of 'debt management', what comes to mind? Is debt good or bad?"
  - Student's answer: "债务不是好事，特别是你没有足够多收入的时间" (Debt is not good, especially when you don't have enough income)
  - Assessment: Common view - understands debt can be risky, but doesn't yet know about "good debt" vs "bad debt" distinction

- **Question 2:** "What common types of debt do you know about?"
  - Student's answer: "不了解" (Not familiar)
  - Assessment: Starting fresh - good opportunity to build foundation

- **Question 3:** "If a client asks 'What strategy should I use to pay off credit card debt?', what methods would you think of?"
  - Student's answer: "逐步还清" (Gradually pay off)
  - Assessment: Basic understanding that debt should be paid off, but doesn't know specific strategies yet

#### Key Concepts Introduced (Lecture Phase)

**1. "Good Debt" vs "Bad Debt" Concept**

**"Good Debt"** - Debt that helps build wealth:
- Mortgage (3-7% interest) - buying appreciating asset (home)
- Student Loans (4-8% interest) - investing in education, increases future earning
- Business Loans - investing in business, creates income
- **Characteristics:** Low interest, buying appreciating assets, increases future income

**"Bad Debt"** - Consumer debt that doesn't create value:
- Credit Card Debt (18-25% interest) - buying consumables
- Payday Loans (300-400% APR) - short-term high-interest
- Auto Loans (4-10% interest) - car depreciates (gray area, sometimes necessary)
- **Characteristics:** High interest, buying depreciating assets or consumables

**CFP Principle:**
- ✅ Good debt can be a wealth-building tool (if managed properly)
- ❌ Bad debt destroys wealth, should be paid off ASAP

**2. Common Debt Types Overview**

Taught comprehensive debt type comparison table:
- Mortgage: 3-7%, 15-30 year term, secured by home → Good debt
- Student Loans: 4-8%, 10-25 year term, unsecured → Good debt (if reasonable)
- Auto Loans: 4-10%, 3-7 year term, secured by car → Use cautiously
- Credit Cards: 18-25%, revolving credit, unsecured → Bad debt
- Personal Loans: 8-15%, 2-5 year term, unsecured → Usually bad debt
- Home Equity Loans: 5-9%, 5-15 year term, secured by home → Depends on use

**Key Terms Introduced:**
- **Secured Debt (有抵押债务):** Has collateral (house, car), lower interest, default = lose asset
- **Unsecured Debt (无抵押债务):** No collateral (credit cards), higher interest, default = credit damage

#### Comprehension Checks

- A. $200K mortgage @ 4.5% for primary residence
