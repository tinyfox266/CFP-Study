**Assessment**: Perfect starting point - honest about gaps, ready to learn

---

### 1. 529 College Savings Plan - "King" of Education Savings

**Concepts Taught**:

**Tax Benefits:**
- Contributions: After-tax (no federal deduction, many states give state tax deduction)
- Growth: TAX-FREE (no taxes on investment gains)
- Withdrawals: TAX-FREE if used for qualified education expenses
- Penalty: Income tax + 10% penalty on earnings if used for non-education

**Contribution Limits:**
- Very high aggregate limits ($300K-$500K+ per beneficiary)
- No annual contribution limit (but gift tax considerations)
- Anyone can contribute (parents, grandparents, relatives, friends)

**Qualified Expenses:**
- College: tuition, fees, room & board, books, computers
- K-12 private school: up to $10K/year (since 2017)

**Flexibility:**
- Can change beneficiary to another family member (tax-free, penalty-free)
- Can use at any accredited U.S. college or many abroad
- NEW 2024: Can roll up to $35,000 to beneficiary's Roth IRA

**Gift Tax Rules:**
- Annual gift tax exclusion (2024-2025): $18,000 per person
- 5-year superfunding: $90,000 (single) or $180,000 (married couple)
- Must file Form 709, cannot give other gifts to that person for 5 years

**State Tax Benefits:**
- Most states offer state income tax deduction ($2K-$10K/year typically)
- Usually must use own state's plan to get deduction

**Investment Options:**
- Age-based portfolios (automatic rebalancing from stocks → bonds)
- Similar to target-date retirement funds

---

### 2. First Comprehension Check - 529 Basics

**Question 1**: How is 529 tax treatment similar to Roth IRA (from B.7)?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "Investment gains are tax-free. As long as withdrawals are used for education expenses, they are tax-free."

**Assessment**: ✓✓ **PERFECT!**
- Correctly identified tax-free growth
- Correctly identified conditional tax-free withdrawals (education vs retirement)
- Excellent connection to B.7 Roth IRA concept

---

**Question 2**: Parents contribute $50K, grows to $100K, all used for college tuition. How much tax on the $50K gains?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "不需要交税" (No need to pay tax)

**Assessment**: ✓ **CORRECT!** $0 in taxes - perfect understanding

**Teaching Enhancement**: Showed comparison:
- Taxable account: $7,500 tax (15% capital gains on $50K gains) → $92,500 available
- 529 Plan: $0 tax → $100,000 available
- **Savings: $7,500!**

---

### 3. Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA)

**Concepts Taught**:

**Tax Treatment:**
- Same as 529: After-tax contributions, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals for education

**Key Differences from 529:**

**Contribution Limits:**
- **ONLY $2,000 per year per beneficiary** (much lower than 529!)
- All contributors combined cannot exceed $2,000
- Contributions end when child turns 18

**Income Limits:**
- Phase-out: $95K-$110K (single), $190K-$220K (married)
- High earners locked out completely

**Qualified Expenses:**
- K-12 expenses (more flexible than 529)
- College expenses (same as 529)

**Age Limit:**
- Must use funds by age 30 or pay penalty (529 has no age limit)

**CFP Perspective:** Less popular due to $2,000/year limit - insufficient for most college savings

---

### 4. Comprehension Check - ESA Application

**Question**: Chen family needs $776/month ($9,312/year) for education. Can they use Coverdell ESA as main vehicle?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "Not worthwhile. Because Coverdell ESA annual quota is only $2,000, but Chen family needs $776×12 per year, far higher than quota."

**Assessment**: ✓✓✓ **PERFECT!**
- Correct calculation: $776 × 12 = $9,312/year
- Correct comparison: $9,312 >> $2,000
- Correct conclusion: ESA insufficient
- **EXCELLENT integration with B.13 Chen family scenario!**

**CFP Insight Added**: When IS ESA useful?
- Supplement to 529 (extra $2K/year)
- K-12 private school expenses
- But not for serious college savings

---

### 5. UTMA/UGMA Custodial Accounts

**Concepts Taught**:

**What it is:**
- UTMA = Uniform Transfers to Minors Act
- UGMA = Uniform Gifts to Minors Act
- "Give money directly to child, parent manages until age 18-21"

**Tax Treatment:**
- **NO special tax benefits** (regular taxable account)
- Investment gains taxed annually
- "Kiddie Tax" rules apply

**Ownership:**
- **Money belongs to THE CHILD** (not parents!)
- Irrevocable - can't take it back
- Child gets full control at age of majority (18-21)

**The BIG Risk:**
- Child turns 18, gets $50K, spends on sports car instead of college
- Parents have ZERO control

**Financial Aid Impact:**
- Counts as **student's asset** → Reduces aid by up to 20% of value
- 529 counts as parent's asset → Only reduces aid by ~5.64%

**CFP Recommendation:** Most planners avoid UTMA/UGMA for large education savings due to:
- No tax benefits
- Loss of control
- Worse financial aid impact

---

### 6. Roth IRA Creative Strategy

**Concepts Taught**:

**How it works:**
- Contribute to parent's own Roth IRA
- **Contributions** can be withdrawn anytime tax-free, penalty-free
- **Earnings** can be withdrawn penalty-free (but taxed) for education

**Example:**
- Contribute $30K over 10 years
- Grows to $50K ($30K + $20K earnings)
- Withdraw $30K contributions: tax-free, penalty-free
- Withdraw $20K earnings: penalty-free, but taxed

**Pros:**
- Dual purpose: college OR retirement
- Financial aid: retirement accounts don't count in FAFSA
- Flexibility: not locked into education

**Cons:**
- Lower limits ($7K/year, or $8K if age 50+)
- Income limits for eligibility
- Takes away from retirement savings

**CFP Perspective:** Backup strategy only - ONLY if already maxing out retirement AND have extra

**Critical Principle:** Retirement comes FIRST! (B.13 principle)

---

### 7. Vehicle Comparison - Wang Family Scenario

**Scenario:**
- Parents age 35, income $150K/year
- Daughter age 8 (college in 10 years)
- Goal: Save $700/month ($8,400/year)
- Current savings: $0

**Question 1**: Which vehicle for PRIMARY account?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "529"

**Assessment**: ✓ **CORRECT!**

---

**Question 2**: Why? Give 2+ reasons.

**Student's Response** (in Chinese):
"Need to save $8,400 per year, 529 can meet the quota. Retirement account money is not enough yet, retirement account still needs to continue saving, should separate from education fund."

**Assessment**: ✓✓✓ **EXCEPTIONAL CFP REASONING!**

**What Student Demonstrated:**
1. ✓ Perfect calculation: $700 × 12 = $8,400/year
2. ✓ Eliminated ESA (only $2,000 limit - insufficient)
3. ✓ Eliminated Roth IRA (retirement priority at age 35!)
4. ✓ **Outstanding CFP judgment:** "Must keep retirement and education separate"
5. ✓ **Applied B.13 principle:** Retirement comes first!

**Additional Reasons Taught:**
- Tax benefits (vs UTMA/UGMA taxed annually)
- Parental control (vs UTMA/UGMA child gets control at 18)
- State tax deduction (potential $200-$800/year savings)
- Better financial aid treatment (5.64% vs 20%)

---

### 8. Advanced Topic - Li Family Grandparents Scenario

**Scenario:**
- Grandparents age 70, wealthy
- Grandson age 5 (college in 13 years)
- Want to contribute $50,000 one-time gift
- Goal: Reduce taxable estate while helping education

---

**Question 1**: Which vehicle?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "529"

**Assessment**: ✓ **CORRECT!**

---

**Question 2**: Can they contribute full $50K without gift tax? How?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "Yes. Through 529 plan, can give 5 years at once, quota is $9,000."

**Assessment**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY CORRECT - NEEDS CORRECTION**

**Issue Identified:**
- ✓ Correct concept: 5-year superfunding
- ✗ **INCORRECT amount:** Said "$9,000 quota"
- Correct amount: $18,000 (current 2024-2025 annual exclusion)
- Note: $9,000 was the limit ~20 years ago (outdated information)

**Correction Taught:**
- Current annual gift tax exclusion: **$18,000 per person** (2024-2025)
- Single grandparent: $18,000 × 5 = **$90,000 limit**
- Married grandparents: $18,000 × 5 × 2 = **$180,000 limit**
- $50,000 < both limits → ✓ YES, can contribute without gift tax

**Student Response to Correction:** Quickly understood and corrected

---

**Question 3**: What if grandson doesn't go to college? Can they get money back or redirect it?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "529 can only be used for education expenses."

**Assessment**: ❌ **INCOMPLETE** - Missing flexibility options

**Correction Taught:**

**Option 1: Change Beneficiary** (Most flexible!)
- Can transfer to another family member (sibling, cousin, even grandparents!)
- Tax-free, penalty-free
- Money stays in family for generations

**Option 2: Withdraw with Penalty**
- Income tax + 10% penalty on earnings only
- Contributions come out tax/penalty-free

**Option 3: NEW 2024 Rule - Roth IRA Rollover**
- Can roll up to $35,000 to beneficiary's Roth IRA
- Conditions: 529 open 15+ years, subject to annual Roth limits ($7K/year)
- Tax-free, penalty-free transfer
- Takes ~5 years to move full $35K

**Key Takeaway:** 529 is MORE FLEXIBLE than most people think!

---

### 9. Verification of Corrections

**Question 1**: Single grandmother, 5-year superfunding in 2025 - maximum contribution?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "Maximum is $90,000"

**Assessment**: ✓ **PERFECT!** Correction understood.

---

**Question 2**: Can change beneficiary to sibling without taxes/penalties?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "Yes, can"

**Assessment**: ✓ **CORRECT!**

---

**Question 3**: New 2024 Roth IRA rollover rule?

**Student's Response** (in Chinese): "Can transfer maximum $35,000, each year maximum $7,000"

- Correct maximum: $35,000
- Correct annual limit: $7,000 (subject to Roth contribution limits)

**All corrections successfully absorbed!**

## Instructor Notes

**Most Impressive Moment**:
Wang family scenario - Student independently applied B.13 retirement priority principle ("retirement account money not enough yet, should separate from education fund") without prompting. This shows the concepts are being internalized and integrated across topics, not just memorized in isolation.

**Teaching Success**:
The correction method for gift tax exclusion worked perfectly. Rather than just telling the student the correct amount, I:
1. Acknowledged the correct concept (5-year superfunding)
2. Corrected the specific amount ($9K → $18K)
3. Explained why ($9K was old, $18K is current)
4. Verified understanding with follow-up questions
Result: Perfect understanding demonstrated on final assessment.

**New 2024 Rule Importance**:
The Roth IRA rollover rule ($35K max) is NEW for recent CFP exams. Student now knows this cutting-edge information, which shows comprehensive preparation beyond just basic concepts.

**Integration Excellence**:
Student is consistently connecting new topics to previous learning:
- B.14 → B.13 (Chen family scenario)
- B.14 → B.7 (Roth IRA tax treatment comparison)
- B.14 → B.12 (time value of money for growth calculations)
This integration is exactly what the CFP exam tests and what professional practice requires.

**Overall Assessment**:
Another outstanding session. Student continues to progress rapidly through Domain B with consistent mastery. The combination of quick learning, excellent quantitative skills, CFP-level judgment, and integration thinking demonstrates strong trajectory toward exam readiness. Only 2 more topics to complete Domain B!
