# CFP Study Session - December 18, 2025

## Session Overview
- **Date**: December 18, 2025
- **Duration**: ~90 minutes (estimated)
- **Format**: Interactive Q&A with comprehension checks
- **Main Domain**: Investment Planning (Domain D - 17% of exam)
- **Student's Starting Level**: Complete beginner in Investment Planning

## Session Goals
- Introduce foundational concepts of Investment Planning
- Build understanding from zero knowledge to solid foundation
- Cover basic investment categories, risk types, and portfolio management

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Basic Investment Categories
**Concepts Taught:**
- Three main asset classes: Equity (Stocks), Fixed Income (Bonds), Cash Equivalents
- Stocks = Ownership of a company
- Bonds = Lending money to company/government
- Risk-return tradeoff: Higher return = Higher risk

**Student's Understanding:**
- ✅ Correctly identified that buying stock = becoming partial owner
- ✅ Understood that bonds are debt, not ownership
- ✅ Grasped the fundamental principle that risk and return are positively correlated

**Comprehension Check Results:**
- Question: "If you want to own Microsoft, should you buy stock or bonds?"
- Initial answer: Misunderstood (thought high risk means don't buy)
- After clarification: ✅ Correctly answered "Stock" and explained ownership concept

---

### 2. Diversification & Investment Vehicles
**Concepts Taught:**
- "Don't put all eggs in one basket"
- Mutual Funds and ETFs provide automatic diversification
- Diversification reduces risk by spreading investments across many companies

**Student's Understanding:**
- ✅ Excellent understanding - explained that probability of 500 companies failing simultaneously is much lower than 1 company failing
- ✅ Used expected value reasoning: recognized that concentrated bets have high downside probability

**Key Insight from Student:**
"这是一个概率问题...如果赚50%的概率是20%，但亏50%的概率是80%，那期望是亏30%"
- This shows sophisticated probabilistic thinking
- Student naturally applied expected value framework without prompting

---

### 3. Risk Types: Systematic vs Unsystematic
**Concepts Taught:**
- **Unsystematic Risk**: Company-specific, can be diversified away
- **Systematic Risk**: Market-wide, cannot be diversified away
- Examples of each type

**Student's Understanding:**
- Initial confusion: Classified "global recession" as unsystematic risk ❌
- After correction: ✅ Fully grasped the distinction
- Successfully classified new examples:
  - Tesla factory fire → Unsystematic ✅
  - Pharmaceutical patent expiry → Unsystematic ✅
  - Fed rate hikes → Systematic ✅
  - Global oil price surge → Systematic ✅

**Student's Memory Aid:**
"Un-systematic = 不是全部 = 只影响个别"
"Systematic = System = 整个系统"

---

### 4. Asset Allocation
**Concepts Taught:**
- How to allocate between stocks/bonds/cash
- Three factors: Time Horizon, Risk Tolerance, Investment Objectives
- Young investors with long horizons → more stocks
- Near-retirees with short horizons → more bonds

**Student's Understanding:**
- ✅ Excellent - identified that 25-year-old can take more risk than 65-year-old
- ✅ Recognized that young person has time to "start over" (重头再来)
- ✅ **Critical insight**: Understood that time horizon matters MORE than age
  - Example: 28-year-old saving for house next year → should be conservative
  - This shows deep understanding, not just memorization

**Comprehension Check Results:**
All three scenarios correctly analyzed:
- 35yo saving for college in 20 years → More stocks ✅
- 28yo buying house next year → More bonds/cash ✅
- Reasoning was sound and well-articulated

---

### 5. Portfolio Rebalancing
**Concepts Taught:**
- Why rebalance: maintain risk level, enforce discipline
- Rebalancing forces "buy low, sell high"
- Time-based vs threshold-based approaches

**Student's Understanding:**
- ✅ Immediately understood the mechanics (sell what went up, buy what went down)
- ✅ Grasped the counter-intuitive wisdom: buying assets that went down is buying at discount
- ✅ Recognized that rebalancing fights emotional biases (fear and greed)

**Key Quote from Student:**
"股票相对变便宜了，应该买入，股票价格长期会涨回来"
- This demonstrates understanding of long-term value investing principles
- Shows student thinks beyond short-term price movements

---

### 6. Specific Risk Types
**Concepts Taught:**
Seven major investment risks:
1. Market Risk (systematic, affects all assets)
2. Interest Rate Risk (mainly affects bonds, inverse relationship)
3. Inflation Risk (purchasing power loss, hurts cash/bonds most)
4. Liquidity Risk (inability to sell quickly without loss)
5. Currency Risk (exchange rate fluctuations)
6. Business Risk (company-specific, unsystematic)
7. Political/Regulatory Risk (government policy changes)

**Student's Understanding:**
All comprehension checks passed with flying colors:

**Question Set 1:**
- Fed raises rates → Interest Rate Risk ✅
- Who's more affected, stocks or bonds? → Bonds ✅
- Reasoning: Borrowing costs increase, bond prices fall ✅

**Question Set 2:**
- Bank deposit 0.5% with 4% inflation → Inflation Risk ✅
- Real return calculation: -3.5% ✅ (perfectly calculated)

**Question Set 3:**
- Market crash 20% → Market Risk ✅
- Can diversification help? → No, whole market fell ✅

**Complex Scenario Analysis:**
Student correctly identified multiple risks in each scenario:
1. Small startup stock → Liquidity Risk + Business Risk ✅
2. Brazilian bonds (unstable economy) → Political + Currency + Interest Rate Risk ✅
3. 100 large-cap stocks → Diversified away Business/Liquidity risks, but Market/Political risks remain ✅

**Minor gap filled:**
- Student didn't initially mention inflation risk still exists in scenario 3
- After gentle reminder, acknowledged systematic risks (inflation, interest rate) persist

---

## Student's Strengths Observed

1. **Quick Learner**: Progressed from zero knowledge to solid foundation in one session
2. **Analytical Thinking**: Naturally applies probabilistic and expected value reasoning
3. **Deep Understanding**: Doesn't just memorize - understands WHY (e.g., rebalancing = buy low)
4. **Self-Correction**: When corrected on systematic vs unsystematic risk, immediately grasped the concept
5. **Practical Application**: Can correctly analyze multi-factor scenarios (Brazilian bonds example)
6. **Retention**: Successfully applied earlier concepts (systematic risk) to later topics

## Teaching Approach Used

**Socratic Method - Successful Implementation:**
- Started each topic by asking what student already knows
- Used real-world examples (Tesla fire, global recession, house buying)
- Comprehension checks after every major concept
- When student made errors, guided to correct answer through questioning
- Built new concepts on previously learned foundations

**Analogies Used:**
- "Eggs in baskets" for diversification
- "Buying apples on sale" for rebalancing
- "Restaurant owner vs lender" for stocks vs bonds

**Bilingual Approach:**
- Student comfortable mixing English and Chinese
- Key terms taught in English, explanations in Chinese when needed
- This flexibility helped comprehension

### Best Moments:
1. Student's probabilistic thinking on concentrated vs diversified investing
2. "Aha moment" when understanding rebalancing = buying at discount
3. Successfully analyzing Brazilian bonds scenario with multiple risk factors

### Areas for Future Focus:
1. Quantitative calculations (returns, yields, valuations)
2. More practice with exam-style multiple choice questions
3. Integration of concepts across domains (e.g., retirement + investment + tax)

## Homework/Follow-up (Optional)

If student wants to reinforce learning:
1. Think about their own investments (if any) - what risks do they face?
2. Look at a mutual fund fact sheet - identify asset allocation
3. Check news for market events - practice identifying risk types
